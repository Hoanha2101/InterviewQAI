# k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) Classifier on MNIST

This project demonstrates how to implement a k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) classifier using NumPy and TensorFlow/Keras for loading and preprocessing the MNIST dataset.

## Overview

The k-NN algorithm is a simple, yet effective, machine learning method used for classification. This implementation predicts the class of each test sample by finding the `k` nearest neighbors in the training data and using majority voting to determine the class label.

## Dataset

The MNIST dataset is a collection of handwritten digits used for training image processing systems. It contains:
- 60,000 training images and labels.
- 10,000 test images and labels.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- TensorFlow/Keras
- Matplotlib (for optional plotting)

## Installation

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy tensorflow matplotlib
```
## Run

```bash
python EX1_MachineLearning/MNIST_MachineLearning.py
```
