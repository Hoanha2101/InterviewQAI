# Image Classification Web App with Flask - MNIST

This project provides a web application using Flask that performs image classification based on the k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm. 

## Overview

The application allows users to:
- Upload images via a web interface.
- Receive a classification result from a pre-trained k-NN model.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- NumPy
- TensorFlow/Keras
- Matplotlib
- PIL (Pillow)

## Installation

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install flask numpy tensorflow matplotlib pillow
```
## Run

```bash
python EX4_PublicAPI/app.py
```
